# History of user-visible changes

## Next

* `company-eclim` shows method overloads and inserts call templates with placeholders.
* `company-clang` ObjC arguments template insertion now requires explicit user action.
* `company-clang-objc-templatify` does not insert spaces after colons anymore.
* `company-clang` is now only initialized in supported buffers.
  So, no error messages if you don't have Clang until you open a C file.
* `company-clang` recognizes Clang included with recent Xcode.
* New commands `company-select-previous-or-abort` and
  `company-select-next-or-abort`, bound to `<up>` and `<down>`.

## 2013-03-19 (0.6)

* Across-the-board bugfixing.
* `company-pysmell` is not used by default anymore.
* Loading of `nxml`, `semantic`, `pymacs` and `ropemacs` is now deferred.
* Candidates from grouped back-ends are merged more conservatively: only
  back-ends that return the same prefix at point are used.
* `company-clang` now shows meta information, too.
* Some performance improvements.
* Fixed two old tooltip annoyances.
* Instead of `overrriding-terminal-local-map`, we're now using
  `emulation-mode-map-alists` (experimental).  This largely means that when the
  completion keymap is active, other minor modes' keymaps are still used, so,
  for example, it's not as easy to accidentally circumvent `paredit-mode`
  when it's enabled.
* `company-elisp` has seen some improvements.
* Added `company-capf`: completion adapter using
  `completion-at-point-functions`.  (Stefan Monnier)
* Clang completions now include macros and are case-sensitive.
* Switching between tag files now works correctly with `company-etags`.
